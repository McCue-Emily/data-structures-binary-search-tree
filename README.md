## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to:
1.	Familiarize students with **trees**

## Program
### Binary Search Tree and Inorder, Preorder, Postorder Traversal
Randomly generate 100 unique values in the range of [1-200] and insert them into a binary search tree (BST). Print height and inorder, preorder, and postoder output of the BST tree. Deliver source code and a test file that shows the result of printing height and inorder, preorder, and postorder traversal.
